To visualize how matrix multiplication works, we are going to use the curve
f(t) = <t, t> (which is the function y=x+10 parametrized).

As explained on lintrans.md (https://github.com/dylannalex/curvipy/blob/master/docs/lintrans.md)
we can think of f(t) graph as the curve formed by drawing all the f(t) image
vectors, and then joining their heads.

For doing this let's define two matrices:

                    A = [ 0  1 ]        B = [ 1  1 ] 
                        [-1  0 ]            [ 0  1 ] 

- A rotates vectors 90Â° anticlockwise
- B is a shear matrix (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shear_matrix)

If AB = BA, transforming f(t) by AB would generate the same function
as transforming f(t) by BA.

NOTE: keep in mind that applying linear transformations to parametrized
functions means applying the linear transformation to each vector of the
parametrized function. Again, check out lintrans.md for more info.

"""
As you could see, f(t) transformed by AB is different from f(t) transformed
by BA. This means we find a counterexample for AB = BA.
